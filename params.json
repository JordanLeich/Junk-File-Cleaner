This script is set to automatically run everyday at 1:30pm, once running the script will open a pre-installed cleaning program that is on every windows PC and then open two other junk folders inside of windows to clean up.\r\n\r\n![Junk Folders](images/junk.jpg \"Junk Folders\")\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
